All images in the Third_Party folder have been purchased from an artist or vendor
and are licensed to this project for commercial use but *not* for distribution.
Specifically, icons purchased from iconfinder.com are licensed under the basic
license that can be found here:

https://support.iconfinder.com/en/articles/18231-license-basic

Which includes restrictions where licensed material may not be placed "On any
website in a complete or archived downloadable format. This means you can use
it on a website for a design/feature purpose, but it cannot be shared with the
purpose of making it downloadable e.g. with a download button or similar. In
short, no redistribution is allowed." and also "On any electronic bulletin board
or downloadable format"

To stay in compliance with this license, the Third Party content has been
altered significantly so that it can be included in the public code repository
for Infirmary Integrated, allowing programmers to download the entire code
repository, compile the code, and run the code without running into errors due
to missing files. While this does not advance the development of Infirmary
Integrated, it allows programmers to seamlessly analyze and study the project
without barrier.

However, the original Third Party content remains encrypted and password protected
in the /Assets/Third_Party.7z file in thie code repository so the package
maintainer can place the original assets into the project for the purpose of
publishing binary releases of Infirmary Integrated. To remain in compliance with
the licenses covering the Third Party content, the files cannot be shared in
or posted publicly in their original form.

This notice is being included in response to multiple questions on this topic
that can be found in the Git discussion board here:
