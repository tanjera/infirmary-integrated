File Format:

WaveName:[WaveName]
DrawResolution:[DrawResolution]
DrawLength:[DrawLength]
IndexOffset:[IndexOffset]
Vertices:[(x1 y1) (x2 y2) ...]


Notes:
WaveName: must be a compatible string for both a function name and a file name!
DrawResolution: drawing resolution *in milliseconds per point*
DrawLength: length of the waveform *in seconds*
IndexOffset: offset for when the waveform's "starting point" is; used for back-tracing
Vertices: actual vertices, x is the integer index, y is the double amplitude
